# 🗄️ Claw Drive

**Google Drive stores your files. Claw Drive understands them.**

Claw Drive is an AI-managed personal drive for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). It auto-categorizes your files, tags them for cross-cutting search, deduplicates by content, and retrieves them in natural language — all backed by Google Drive for cloud sync and security.

## Why

Traditional file systems and cloud drives are just dumb containers. You organize everything manually, search by filename, and pray you remember where you put that tax form from last year.

Claw Drive flips this: **you hand it a file, it figures out the rest.**

- 📂 **Auto-categorize** — files sorted into the right folder without you thinking about it
- 🏷️ **Smart tagging** — cross-category search (a vet invoice is both `medical` and `invoice`)
- 🔍 **Natural language retrieval** — "find Sorbet's vet records" just works
- 🧬 **Content-aware dedup** — SHA-256 hash check prevents storing the same file twice
- ☁️ **Google Drive backend** — world-class encryption, sync, and backup under the hood
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** — sensitive categories can stay local-only or encrypt before sync

## Architecture

```
You → OpenClaw Agent → Claw Drive (AI layer)
                            │
                      ~/claw-drive/        ← local working directory
                            │
                      Google Drive sync    ← cloud backup & cross-device access
```

- **Local directory** (`~/claw-drive/`) is the source of truth
- **Google Drive** syncs it for backup, cross-device access, and sharing
- **INDEX.md** tracks every file with metadata, tags, and descriptions
- **The AI layer** (OpenClaw skill) handles categorization, tagging, dedup, and retrieval
- **Sensitive files** (`identity/`) can be excluded from sync or encrypted at rest

## Install

Clone into your OpenClaw skills directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dissaozw/claw-drive.git ~/.openclaw/skills/claw-drive
```

Restart your gateway:

```bash
openclaw gateway restart
```

## Setup

Create the drive directory:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/claw-drive/{documents,finance,medical,travel,identity,receipts,contracts,photos,misc}
```

The skill creates `INDEX.md` and `.hashes` on first use.

To enable cloud sync, point Google Drive at `~/claw-drive/` (or symlink it into your Drive folder).

## Categories

| Category | Use for |
|----------|---------|
| `documents/` | General docs, letters, forms, manuals |
| `finance/` | Tax returns, bank statements, pay stubs |
| `medical/` | Health records, prescriptions, pet health |
| `travel/` | Boarding passes, itineraries, visas |
| `identity/` | ID scans, certificates (⚠️ sensitive — consider local-only) |
| `receipts/` | Purchase receipts, warranties, invoices |
| `contracts/` | Leases, employment, legal agreements |
| `photos/` | Personal photos, document scans |
| `misc/` | Anything that doesn't fit above |

## Usage

Just send a file to your OpenClaw agent. It handles:

1. **Classification** — picks the right category
2. **Naming** — descriptive, date-stamped filename
3. **Dedup** — checks if the file already exists (by content hash)
4. **Tagging** — assigns searchable tags across categories
5. **Indexing** — updates INDEX.md with metadata
6. **Reporting** — tells you what it did

To retrieve, just ask: *"find my W-2 from 2025"* or *"show all files tagged sorbet"*.

## Sync

Auto-sync to Google Drive with a background daemon:

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install rclone fswatch

# Configure rclone remote
rclone config

# Create sync config
cat > ~/claw-drive/.sync-config <<EOF
backend: google-drive
remote: gdrive:claw-drive
exclude:
  - identity/
  - .hashes
EOF

# Start the daemon
claw-drive-sync setup   # verify everything
claw-drive-sync start   # background fswatch + rclone
```

Files sync to Google Drive within seconds of any change. The daemon runs as a launchd service — starts on login, restarts on failure. Sensitive directories (like `identity/`) can be excluded from sync.

```bash
claw-drive-sync status  # check if running + last sync time
claw-drive-sync push    # manual one-shot sync
claw-drive-sync stop    # stop the daemon
```

## Roadmap

- [ ] Full-text search (PDF/image text extraction at store time)
- [ ] CLI tool (`claw-drive search "tax 2025"`)
- [ ] Watch folder ingestion (auto-import from Downloads, email, etc.)
- [ ] Encrypted storage for sensitive categories
- [ ] Web dashboard for browsing and search
