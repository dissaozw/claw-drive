Claw Drive is an AI-managed personal drive. It auto-categorizes your files, tags them for cross-cutting search, deduplicates by content, and retrieves them in natural language — all backed by Google Drive for cloud sync and security.

## Features

- 📂 **Auto-categorize** — files sorted into the right folder without you thinking about it
- 🏷️ **Smart tagging** — cross-category search (a vet invoice is both `medical` and `invoice`)
- 🔍 **Natural language retrieval** — "find Sorbet's vet records" just works
- 🧬 **Content-aware dedup** — SHA-256 hash check prevents storing the same file twice
- ☁️ **Google Drive sync** — optional real-time backup via fswatch + rclone
- 🔒 **Privacy-first** — local-first by default, sensitive categories excluded from sync
- 🤖 **AI-native** — designed for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) agents, with a CLI under the hood

## Install

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dissaozw/claw-drive.git ~/.openclaw/skills/claw-drive
cd ~/.openclaw/skills/claw-drive && make install
claw-drive init
```

## Usage

Claw Drive is designed to be used through your AI agent. You don't organize files — your agent does.

### Storing files

Send a file to your agent (Telegram, email, etc.) and it handles everything:

1. **Categorizes** the file into the right folder
2. **Names** it with a descriptive, date-stamped filename
3. **Checks for duplicates** by content hash
4. **Tags** it for cross-category search
5. **Indexes** it in INDEX.md
6. **Reports** back what it did

> 📎 *"Here's Sorbet's vet invoice from today"*
>
> ✅ Stored: `medical/sorbet/sorbet-vet-invoice-2026-02-15.pdf`
> Tags: medical, invoice, sorbet, emergency
> Source: Telegram

### Retrieving files

Just ask in natural language:

> *"Find Sorbet's medical records"*
> *"Show me all invoices from January"*
> *"Do I have a copy of my W-2?"*

The agent searches INDEX.md by description, tags, path, and date — then delivers the file.

### What you never have to do

- Pick a folder
- Think of a filename
- Remember where you put something
- Manually organize anything

## CLI Reference

The CLI is the interface agents use under the hood. All commands support `--json` for machine-readable output.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `claw-drive init` | Initialize drive directory and INDEX.md |
| `claw-drive store <file> [opts]` | Store a file with categorization, tags, and dedup |
| `claw-drive search <query>` | Search files by description, tags, or path |
| `claw-drive list` | List all indexed files |
| `claw-drive tags` | List all tags with usage counts |
| `claw-drive status` | Show drive status (files, size, sync) |
| `claw-drive sync auth` | Authorize Google Drive (one-time, ngrok tunnel) |
| `claw-drive sync setup` | Check sync dependencies and config |
| `claw-drive sync start` | Start background sync daemon |
| `claw-drive sync stop` | Stop sync daemon |
| `claw-drive sync push` | Manual one-shot sync |
| `claw-drive sync status` | Show sync daemon state |
| `claw-drive version` | Show version |

## Sync

Optional real-time sync to Google Drive (or any rclone backend):

```bash
# Install dependencies
brew install rclone fswatch ngrok

# Authorize Google Drive (agent sends you a link to click)
claw-drive sync auth

# Or configure manually
cat > ~/claw-drive/.sync-config <<EOF
backend: google-drive
remote: gdrive:claw-drive
exclude:
  - identity/
  - .hashes
EOF

# Start daemon
claw-drive sync setup
claw-drive sync start
```

Files sync within seconds of any change. Sensitive directories stay local-only.

See [docs/sync.md](docs/sync.md) for details.
